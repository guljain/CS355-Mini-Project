# Goal: 
The goal of this mini project is to provide a realistic experience in the conceptual
design, logical design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a small relational
database.

# Application description: 
The application needs to be developed for IIT Patna Campus
Amenities Administration. The administration needs to keep track of many services for their
users. The detailed specifications are not available, however there are some minimum
points that you need to consider for this project.

There are different kinds of service possibly based upon the type of amenity or facility we
are referring to (such as services related to guest house, market shops, landscape, etc).
1. Guest House Related Service: Such as handling room booking request, food booking,
bill generation, staff duty scheduler, etc
2. Market Shop Related Services: Such as maintaining records for shop keeprs, license
period, extension period, monthly rent/electricity details, feedback/performance
management, etc
3. Landscaping Related Service: Such as maintaining gardeners details, identifying
campus areas, gardeners assignments, duty roster, equipment stock and
maintenance details, handling grass cutting requests
